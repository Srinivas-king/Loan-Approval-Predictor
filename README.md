Final Project: Loan Approval Predictor
🔍 Objective
To create a logistic regression model that predicts whether a loan application should be approved based on applicant information
📌 Project Overview The system predicts loan approvals by analyzing applicant data such as credit score income and debt The project emphasizes model transparency and fairness
🎯 Project Features Load and clean loan applicant dataset
Encode categorical variables and scale numerical ones
Train logistic regression model
Display prediction probabilities and confidence score
Explain predictions using model coefficients
Project Phases
Phase 1: Data Handling Load data and handle null values Label encode categorical fields Normalize numerical columns
Phase 2: Model Development Train logistic regression
